## Stack

This was built using the Technology Stack of Dreams - Nuxt 3, Supabase and Typescript. Other notable mentions are SCSS (BEM methodology), VueDraggableNext, Pinia.

## Features

This is pretty much packed with every basic feature of a kanban board

1. Authentication:
    - Sign in/Sign up with Google or Email and Password
	- Reset and Change password

2. CRUD
	- Create, read, update and delete boards
	- Create, read, update and delete columns
	- Create, read, update and delete tasks and subtasks

3. Miscellaneous
	- Light/dark mode
	- Drag and drop for reordering of tasks and changing of their order

## What I've learnt

During the course of this project, I've learnt and practised to
- Break down the entire project into components for reusability purposes
- Embrace SCSS more
- Work more with Supabase

## Challanges

During the project, I had issues with motivation and hence I had to drop off the project a couple times. I also had a tiny bit of trouble with deeply nested foreign tables in Supabase.
